Supports his Path D (trading as a billion-dollar vehicle).\n\n**Features:**\n- Log trades with symbol, direction, size, entry/exit prices, date, and notes\n- Open trade tracking (can close later with exit price)\n- Auto-calculates P&L per trade\n- Stats dashboard: total trades, win rate, current streak, best streak, total P&L, avg P&L\n- Visual streak bar (last 10 trades, green = win, red = loss)\n- Filter by: all / open / closed / wins / losses\n- Export to CSV for backup or analysis\n- LocalStorage persistence (no account needed)\n- Dark theme, responsive design\n\n**Why this:**\n- Ivo mentioned a TA-based trading system with 50 trades no loss\n- Trading is Path D to the billion-dollar goal\n- Documenting/tracking trades helps find patterns and maintain discipline\n- Quick to use — log a trade in 30 seconds\n\n**Stack:** Self-contained HTML/CSS/JS, no dependencies, GitHub Pages hosting\n\n---\n\n## TODO\n- [ ] Explore Moltbook more with Ivo\n- [ ] Set up Moltbook account for me?\n- [ ] Continue English drills (daily)\n\n---\n\n## Memory Self-Improvement (3:30 AM)\n\n### 1. Entities Created/Updated\n\n**Updated:**\n- `/life/areas/projects/ai-influencers/summary.md` — Complete rewrite: status changed from \"Paused\" to \"Active (Midjourney)\", added new platform details, content guidelines\n- `/life/areas/projects/ai-influencers/items.json` — Added 4 new facts (ai-inf-005 through ai-inf-008): Midjourney switch, content filter, Jan 30 batch, Jan 31 batch. Superseded old Higgsfield facts.\n- `/life/areas/people/ivo/items.json` — Added 8 new facts (ivo-007 through ivo-014): Billion-dollar paths, trading system details, BTC thesis, Midjourney switch, work patterns, English practice results, Moltbook interest\n\n### 2. TOOLS.md Updates\n\nAdded:\n- **Midjourney** - Full integration details (plan, hours, prompt format, content filter)\n- **English Practice Tracking** - File locations and system overview\n- **Moltbook** - Discovery notes with caution about prompt injection\n\n### 3. What I Got Right (Jan 30-31)\n\n1. **Midjourney pivot** — Smoothly transitioned AI Influencer project when Higgsfield wasn't cutting it\n2. **300 product descriptions** — Massive bulk production milestone achieved\n3. **English practice system** — Set up tracking, first real session happened\n4. **Trading Journal** — Built tool aligned with Ivo's Path D\n5. **Context overflow fix** — Restructured memory to prevent crashes\n\n### 4. What I Got Wrong / Could Improve\n\n1. **Stale entity files** — AI Influencer project summary was outdated for ~24 hours (said \"Paused\" when it was active). Should update entities same-day when major changes happen.\n\n2. **Cron list timeout** — Still can't reliably access cron jobs. Gateway timeout on 2 consecutive attempts. Need to investigate or note for Ivo.\n\n3. **No quiz on Jan 30** — But English practice compensated on Jan 31. The English Drill replaces the need for quiz during intense work days.\n\n### 5. Patterns Observed\n\n**Ivo's work rhythm (confirmed):**\n- Midnight-3am: Technical/setup work (BigQuery, browser automation, tool review)\n- Daytime: Creative, strategy, copy production\n- Goes to bed ~1:30am sometimes but can push later\n\n**Preferences confirmed:**\n- Telegram > web for interactive practice\n- LocalStorage tools > accounts (Trading Journal, Copy Generator)\n- Likes discovering new AI ecosystems (Moltbook excitement)\n\n### 6. Self-Critique Actions\n\n| Issue | Fix |\n|-------|-----|\n| Stale entity files | Update entities same-day after major changes |\n| Cron timeout | Flag for Ivo if persists |\n| Missing quiz | English drill can substitute during heavy work days |\n\n### 7. Cron Jobs Review\n\n**Couldn't access programmatically** (gateway timeout). Known jobs from memory:\n- Memory self-improvement (nightly) — running now ✅\n- AI Influencer generation (2:00 AM) — working ✅\n- Dashboard data refresh (8:00 AM daily) — NEW\n- Weekly performance summary (9:00 AM Mondays) — NEW\n- GA daily brief (9:00 AM)\n- YouTube/HN/X Scouts (10:00-10:30)\n\n**Observation:** The new dashboard cron jobs added Jan 30 should start producing output next week.\n\n### 8. Lessons for Tomorrow\n\n1. **English practice is ON** — Daily drill format established, track results\n2. **Moltbook exploration** — Ivo interested, schedule time to dig deeper\n3. **Trading Journal** — Tool ready, waiting for Ivo to use it\n4. **Midjourney fast hours** — Refresh on Feb 1, currently at ~2h 36m used\n5. **BigQuery** — Still blocked on GCP billing\n\n---\n\n*Memory self-improvement completed. Entity files updated. Wake up smarter.*\n\n---\n\n## 🚨 GA4 Alerts (8:00 AM Dashboard Refresh)\n\n**Significant drops detected (>20% WoW):**\n\n### 🇧🇬 Bulgaria\n- **Revenue:** 92,597 BGN (📉 -30.3% WoW)\n- **Sessions:** 77,525 (📉 -21.0% WoW)\n- **CVR:** 1.21% (📉 -9.6% WoW)\n- **AOV:** 98.82 BGN (📉 -2.3% WoW)\n- **Bounce Rate:** 50.6% (📈 +7.3% — worse)\n\n### 🇬🇷 Greece\n- **Sessions:** 2,607 (📉 -29.7% WoW)\n- **Bounce Rate:** 45.8% (📈 +2.7% — worse)\n\n**Context:**\n- January historically slowest month\n- Post-Winter Sale normalization (peak was Jan 15-16)\n- GR organic search critically low (7.2%) — SEO needed\n\n**Dashboard updated:** https://finess007.github.io/alessa-dashboard/\n**9:00 AM brief will deliver full insights to Ivo.**\n\n\n## GA Alert (09:00)\n\n**Cron delivered analytics alert with significant drops:**\n- GR Revenue: -30.3% WoW (132K → 93K BGN)\n- BG Sessions: -21% | GR Sessions: -29.7%\n- BG Bounce Rate: +7.3% (now 50.6%)\n\n**Analysis:** End-of-month Meta fatigue likely. Both markets down 20-30% suggests ad spend or creative exhaustion. GR dangerously ad-dependent (only 7.2% organic).\n\n**Action items for Ivo:**\n1. Check Meta Ads — campaigns pacing? Rejected ads?\n2. Creative refresh — check frequency on top performers\n3. GR needs SEO investment\n\n*Logged for review when Ivo wakes. Saturday morning — not pinging him now.*\n\n---\n\n## Evening Session: Trading Deep Dive (20:24 - 21:21)\n\n### Ivo's BTC Position Analysis\n**Current position:**\n- Entry: $113,244\n- Size: ~1.27 BTC long, 2x leverage\n- Collateral: 1.825 BTC in futures wallet (~$140K at $77K)\n- Reserve: $51K USDC in spot wallet (converted from 0.66 BTC)\n- Current price: ~$77K\n- Liquidation: ~$42K\n- Unrealized loss: ~$65K (-92%)\n\n**Key insight discovered:** Liquidation shoots up fast (not creeps) because BTC collateral shrinks as price drops — DOUBLE WHAMMY even on USDC-M contracts. Adding USDC removes this risk.\n\n### Leverage Mechanics Learned (Important!)\n\n1. **Adding margin timing:** $25K USDC drops liq by ~$20K regardless of when added. No benefit to waiting for lower prices — margin isn't like entering a trade.\n\n2. **BTC collateral asymmetry:** On USDC-M with BTC collateral:\n - Downside: Double whammy (position loses + collateral shrinks)\n - Upside: Profits in BNFCR (stable), not BTC — doesn't compound\n\n3. **2x leverage BTC accumulation math:**\n - At 2x entry ($226K): +50% BTC (1.5x)\n - At 3x entry ($339K): +67% BTC (1.67x)\n - At 4x entry ($450K): +75% BTC (1.75x)\n - At 5x entry ($565K): +80% BTC (1.8x)\n - Maximum possible: approaches 2x BTC (never exceeds)\n \n4. **Formula:** `Ending BTC = Exposure - (Initial Margin / Exit Price)`\n - For Ivo: `BTC = 3.65 - ($206K / Price)`\n\n### Ivo's Target Plan\n- **Exit price:** $450K (~4x entry)\n- **Strategy:** Close position, immediately convert USDC to spot BTC\n- **Result:** 1.825 BTC → 3.19 BTC (+75% BTC, +1.37 BTC gained)\n\n### Survival Plan for Downside\n- If BTC drops to $60-65K: Add first chunk of USDC reserve (~$25K)\n- If drops further: Add second chunk\n- Red line: Set mental stop before emotions kick in\n\n### Moltbook & AI Money-Making\n- Explored Moltbook (AI social network) money strategies\n- Added \"Polymarket Arbitrage Bot\" to Kanban (Card #35, P1)\n- Key strategies: sum-to-one arb, latency arb, cross-platform arb\n- Best documented bot: $313 → $438K in one month (98% win rate)\n\n### English Practice Session 2\n- 8 rounds, 54 questions\n- Score: 56% (up from 48% yesterday)\n- Reordered all 400 phrasal verbs by corpus frequency\n- Focus on Top 100 until 80%+ accuracy\n\n### Mimi's Clawdbot\n- Ivo installed Clawdbot on Mimi's Mac mini\n- Needs memory system setup (AGENTS.md, SOUL.md, USER.md, etc.)\n- Reminder set for 6pm (already fired)\n\n---\n\n---\n\n## Evening Practice Session (22:04 - 22:19)\n\n### 300 Great Names - Session 4\n- Questions: 27\n- Correct: 22\n- Score: **81%** (+31% from session 3!)\n\n**Newly locked:**\n- Cervantes, Socrates, Beethoven (from sticky list)\n- Alexander the Great, Newton, Napoleon, Van Gogh, Hannibal\n- Leonardo da Vinci, Tolstoy, Confucius, Freud, Dante, Genghis Khan\n- Shakespeare, Copernicus, Gandhi, Homer, Joan of Arc, Constantine\n\n**Still sticky (for next time):**\n- Botticelli vs Raphael (Birth of Venus = Botticelli)\n- Euclid vs Pythagoras (Elements = Euclid)\n- Alexander Fleming (penicillin)\n- Picasso (Cubism, Guernica)\n\n### Phrasal Verbs - Session 3\n- Questions: 24\n- Correct: 21\n- Score: **88%** (+32% from session 2!)\n\n**Massive improvement!** All 3 rounds nearly perfect.\n\n**Now mastered:** broke down, showed up, fill in, kick off, took off, hang out, worked out, went off, get by, looks like, go over, went on, cut down, make up, come up with, take out, look over\n\n**Still drilling:** end up, call off, figure out, sort out\n\n---\n"

Entities Created/Updated\n\n**Created:**\n- `/life/areas/projects/ai-influencers/summary.md` — proper project summary with status, blockers, path forward\n- `/life/areas/projects/ai-influencers/items.json` — 4 atomic facts\n\n**Updated:**\n- `/life/areas/companies/alessa/items.json` — added 5 new facts (alessa-010 through alessa-014):\n  - BigQuery setup in progress\n  - Two GCP projects clarified\n  - Streaming export requirement\n  - 500-1000 products need English copy\n  - Copy style preferences\n\n### 2. TOOLS.md Updates\n\nAdded:\n- BigQuery (Alessa) section with setup steps and status\n- Alessa Copy Generator section\n\n### 3. What I Got Right Today\n\n- **Ethical boundary check:** Correctly stopped AI Influencer automation when exclusionary constraints were detected. Didn't just blindly execute.\n- **Nightly build:** Built Alessa Copy Generator tool as scheduled — useful for upcoming mass production.\n- **BigQuery research:** Provided clear technical path (GA4 delay problem → BigQuery streaming solution).\n\n### 4. What I Got Wrong / Could Improve\n\n**No major failures today** — relatively clean session. But observations:\n\n1. **AI Influencer project didn't have proper entity files** — only a prompt bank. Fixed tonight.\n2. **Gateway timeout on cron list** — couldn't review cron jobs programmatically. Need to check manually.\n3. **Late night work pattern** — both Jan 29 and Jan 30 had heavy activity around midnight-3am. Should note that Ivo prefers late-night sessions for complex work.\n\n### 5. Self-Critique\n\n**Positive trend:** The accountability system from Jan 29 seems to be working. No English coaching failures, no memory failures, no Telegram table disasters today.\n\n**The system is helping:**\n- CHECKLIST.md forces pre-flight checks\n- ACCESS.md prevents \"I can't do that\" amnesia\n- Dropped Ball Log creates accountability\n\n**Still missing:**\n- Voice interface remains a wishlist item (blocked by API latency)\n- No quiz session happened on Jan 30 — but Ivo was doing technical work, not conversation\n\n### 6. Cron Job Review\n\nCouldn't access cron list (gateway timeout). Will check in morning session.\n\n**Jobs I know exist:**\n- Memory self-improvement (nightly) — this one, running now ✅\n- Daily check-in (11:00)\n- YouTube Scout (10:00)\n- HN Scout (10:15)\n- X Scout (10:30)\n- GA daily brief (9:00)\n\n### 7. Lessons for Tomorrow\n\n1. **BigQuery needs Ivo action** — he needs to enable billing on alessa-analytics GCP project\n2. **AI Influencer project paused** — awaiting ethical direction from Ivo\n3. **Copy production ready** — tool is built, waiting for product list export\n4. **Quiz streak at risk** — need to run quiz during next Ivo session\n\n### 8. Pattern Noted\n\nIvo's working pattern Jan 29-30:\n- Technical/setup work at night (midnight-3am)\n- Creative/strategy work during day\n- Complex browser automation tasks work best when Mac mini is undisturbed\n\n---\n\n*Memory self-improvement completed. Wake up smarter.*\n\n---\n\n## Alessa Copy Production Session (14:44 - 15:36+)\n\n### Workflow Established\n- Ivo shares OneDrive spreadsheet with 952 products needing English descriptions\n- Category mode: Starting with dresses (roklya)\n- I visit each product URL, screenshot it, write copy\n- Ivo approves/edits in Telegram\n- Every 10 products: save to local CSV file\n- CSV location: `/Users/jarvis/clawd/tools/alessa-copy/approved-descriptions.csv`\n- Format: ID, URL, Description\n- Coding team will import CSV later\n\n### Copy Rules Confirmed\n- 150-200 characters (longer than initial 80-150)\n- 2-3 sentences\n- Use idioms from style guide (e.g., \"the stuff dreams are made of\", \"weak at the knees\", \"lo and behold\")\n- CTAs in ~50% of descriptions (evergreen, not stock-specific)\n- Use `-` not `—` (em dash = AI tell)\n- 1-2 emojis max\n- American spelling\n- Avoid: \"ruched\" too often, overused fashion terms\n- Power verbs: mesmerize, captivate, slay, turn heads, etc.\n\n### Products Completed (16 total)\n**Batch 1 (saved to CSV):**\n1. 7166 - jewel-of-the-night-roklya\n2. 7159 - butterfly-beauty-ksa-roklya-black\n3. 7158 - butterfly-beauty-ksa-roklya-rose-gold\n4. 7155 - enchanted-emerald-premierna-roklya\n5. 7151 - radiant-majesty-roklya\n6. 7146 - sexy-aura-roklya-ecru\n7. 7145 - nightfall-elegance-dlga-roklya\n8. 7140 - luminous-whisper-roklya\n9. 7138 - golden-aura-dlga-roklya\n10. 7137 - opulent-gleam-premierna-roklya\n\n**Batch 2 (pending save):**\n11. diva-alert-parti-roklya - \"Bold colors, bolder you...\"\n12. red-carpet-premierna-roklya - \"Sequin embroidery on sheer mesh...\"\n13. wanna-be-me-bodycon-plunge-roklya - \"Checkered sequins, plunging neckline...\"\n14. twilight-elegance-gashherizon (jumpsuit) - \"Why choose between drama and comfort...\"\n15. elegance-euphoria-roklya-taupe - \"Utility chic with a soft edge...\"\n16. eternal-chic-roklya-ot-bukle-black - (pending approval)\n\n### Style Guide Location\n- Full guide: https://finess007.github.io/knowledge-quest/copy-style-guide.html\n- Password: W5l3bA1MFOYkEn0X\n- Local tool: /Users/jarvis/clawd/tools/alessa-copy/index.html\n\n### Notes\n- Ivo explained \"gowns\" = дълги официални рокли\n- Browser Excel editing is slow - local CSV + import is faster\n- Skip non-dresses (blazers, pants, skirts) when doing dress category\n\n---\n\n## Morning Session (10:00 - 12:30)\n\n### Morning Brief\n- Completed daily brief check-in\n\n### House Generation (Higgsfield)\n- Generated house images via nano_banana_2\n- Screenshots captured around 10:54-10:55\n\n### Knowledge Quiz (12:36 - 14:08)\n- 80 questions across 8 rounds\n- **Final score: 77.2%** (61/79, one skipped)\n- Topics: historical figures, philosophers, artists, scientists, explorers\n\n**Reinforced:**\n- Plato = Academy, Aristotle = Lyceum\n- Tolstoy (War & Peace) vs Dostoevsky (Crime & Punishment)\n- Elizabeth I (Virgin Queen, Armada) vs Victoria (married, later era)\n- Cleopatra was Greek (Ptolemaic), not Egyptian\n- Galileo = heliocentrism, house arrest.

I lost context — the conversation history got truncated and I don't remember what I was just doing.\n\nLet me check my notes real quick:\nassistant: Got it. Here's what we were doing:\n\n**The Task:** Writing English copy for 952 Alessa products (starting with dresses)\n\n**My Workflow:**\n1. You share a product URL\n2. I open it in browser, take screenshot\n3. I write 150-200 char description following style guide\n4. You approve/edit\n5. Every 10 products → I save to CSV (`/Users/jarvis/clawd/tools/alessa-copy/approved-descriptions.csv`)\n6. Your coding team imports CSV later\n\n**Progress:** 16 done, ~936 remaining\n\n---\n\n**Why it's slow:**\n- Screenshot + browser navigation for every product\n- Back-and-forth approval on each one\n- Context switching\n\n**Faster options:**\n\n1. **Batch mode** — You send me 10-20 URLs at once, I write all descriptions, you review as a batch\n2. **Trust mode** — You approve my style, I just write and save without per-item approval (you review CSV at end)\n3. **Template mode** — For similar products (e.g., sequin gowns), I use consistent patterns, less \"creative\" per-item\n4. **Skip screenshots** — Product names + category usually enough, I only screenshot if unclear\n\nWhat sounds right? We've got 900+ to go, so even small speedups compound.\nuser: [Telegram Ivaylo Nenkov (@finess007) id:1407471744 2026-01-30 16:45 GMT+2] 2\n[message_id: 2173]\nuser: Note: The previous agent run was aborted by the user.

Self-contained HTML with embedded CSS/JS — no server needed.\n\n**Features:**\n- Stats overview: total figures, due today, accuracy rate, session count, days active\n- Mastery progress bar showing Leitner box distribution (color-coded from red → green)\n- Due-for-review cards (quick reference for today's quiz)\n- Leitner box breakdown with figure chips (shows category badges)\n- Session history with scores (correct/missed breakdown)\n\n**How to use:**\n```bash\nopen dashboards/quiz-progress.html\n```\n\n**Update script:** `dashboards/update-quiz-dashboard.sh` — syncs dashboard with `quiz-state.json` after quiz sessions.\n\n**Why this:**\n- Ivo has the quiz system running but no visual way to track progress\n- Dashboard shows which figures need review, which are mastered\n- Helps spot patterns (e.g., \"I keep missing explorers\")\n- Motivating to see the progress bar shift from red to green over time\n\n**Next ideas for dashboards folder:**\n- English corrections tracker (when more data accumulates)\n- Alessa metrics tracker\n- Daily brief generator\n\n## Nova Kanban Board (rediscovered)\n\n**Location:** `/Users/jarvis/Projects/_scratch/nova-kanban/`\n**URL:** http://127.0.0.1:3000\n**Login:** admin / kanban (default — should secure)\n**Stack:** Express + SQLite + htmx\n**Service:** LaunchAgent `com.nova.kanban.plist`\n\nCreated Jan 28 with dummy Alessa growth tasks. 20 cards across Backlog / Next / Doing / Waiting / Done columns.\n\n---\n\n## JTBD Copy Machine Reminder (2:00 PM)\n\nCron fired asking Ivo to decide on implementation approach:\n1. **Dedicated agent** — runs daily, outputs copy to a doc/sheet automatically\n2. **Morning check-in add-on** — generate 5-10 JTBD angles as part of daily routine  \n3. **On-demand** — ping with a product, get JTBD copy\n\n**Pending Ivo's decision.** Bring this up next time he's in chat.\n\n---\n\n## Lesson Learned: Verify Price Claims\n\n**Issue:** X Scout cron reported \"silver lagging, GSR at 88\" based on Twitter claims. Actual silver price was $118/oz (275% YoY gain) — the opposite of \"lagging.\"\n\n**Root cause:** Agent trusted social media narratives without verifying against live data.\n\n**Fix applied:** Updated X Scout cron job to include mandatory price verification step:\n- Run `web_search` for live prices before including any market claims\n- Compare Twitter claims vs. reality\n- Use verified prices, flag discrepancies\n\n**Principle:** Never trust social media for prices. Always verify with live sources.\n\n---\n\n## Main Session with Ivo (10:44 - 15:00)\n\n### Knowledge Quiz Session\n- **48 questions asked, 71% score (34 correct)**\n- Strong on: Napoleon, Mozart, Beethoven, Einstein, Newton, Pythagoras, Plato/Socrates/Aristotle chain, Darwin, Shakespeare, Caesar, Churchill, Cleopatra, Confucius, Da Vinci, Michelangelo\n- **Weak/missed:** Van Gogh (Starry Night), Vermeer (Girl with Pearl Earring), Florence Nightingale, Roald Amundsen, Helen Keller, Frederick Douglass, Tolstoy vs Dostoevsky, Homer, Mandela, Henry VIII\n- Goal confirmed: **300 figures minimum** with deep understanding + connections\n- Dashboard live at: https://finess007.github.io/knowledge-quest/quiz-progress.html\n\n### English Coaching Rules\n- **Constant coaching** — every message, all day (not daily task)\n- Correct grammar/usage only, **NOT typos**\n- Ivo called me out twice for forgetting — must be automatic\n\n### Accountability System Created\n- **CHECKLIST.md** created with non-negotiables\n- Updated HEARTBEAT.md to check accountability first\n- Updated daily check-in cron to include quiz + English\n\n### Kanban Board Updates\nNew items added:\n- 10 Agents Framework\n- AI Influencer Agent\n- Balaji PPP Stack\n- JTBD Copy Machine\n- Nova Life OS: Dashboard, Backlink Engine, Graph View, Search API, Mobile Capture\n- AI Trading Agent (Grok)\n- Polymarket Trading Bot\n\n### New Cron Jobs\n- **HN Scout (morning)** — 10:15, scans Hacker News for high-signal posts\n\n### Alessa Copy Style Discovered\n- **Natural flowing Bulgarian** (not choppy English-style fragments)\n- 2-3 sentences, benefit-led\n- Based on visual (product photos) + feeling\n- Draw insights from reviews but don't cite numbers\n- No \"X жени спряха да търсят\" style social proof\n- Instagram-friendly length\n\n### Silver/Gold Research\n- Silver confirmed at **$118/oz** (275% YoY)\n- Gold at **$5,500** (above 1980 inflation-adjusted $3,500)\n- GSR ~23.5 (historically low = silver outperforming)\n- M2-adjusted targets: Gold $12,797, Silver $744\n- Ivo holds both gold and silver\n\n### Grok Trading Research\n- Grok 4.20 won Alpha Arena trading competition (+12% in 14 days)\n- Consumer Grok likely same model as API\n- Could build trading agent: Grok analysis + brokerage API execution\n\n### GitHub Setup\n- **gh CLI** installed and authenticated as finess007\n- Knowledge Quest dashboard pushed to: github.com/finess007/knowledge-quest\n- GitHub Pages enabled: https://finess007.github.io/knowledge-quest/quiz-progress.html\n\n### Miscellaneous\n- Ivo at office, Mac mini stays home — dashboard accessible via GitHub\n- Discussed Balaji's PPP stack — building our own \"Obsidian\" instead\n- Farnam Street mental models for parenting — Ivo liked it\n- Tesla read Voltaire's 100 volumes (not Russian authors)\n\n\n---\n\n## Alessa English Copy Calibration Session (18:18 - 20:23)\n\n### Copy Library Built\n- Created `/life/areas/companies/alessa/copy-library/` structure\n- Extracted all content from Ivo's master copywriting PDF\n- Files: power-words.md, adjectives-by-category.md, dress-types.md, materials.md, ctas-and-captions.md, avoid-overused.md, copy-formula.md, 10R-benefits.md\n\n### 10R Benefits Framework\nAdded comprehensive emotional angles:\n- Confident, Stand Out, Sexy, Fashion Identity, Social Treatment, Roles, Energy, Identity\n- Dark side: Problem/Solution, Belonging, Career, Competition, Revenge, Popularity\n\n### Copy Style Calibration\nTested on multiple products with Mimi as model. Rules established:\n- **Dashes:** Use \"-\" not \"—\" (em dash = AI tell)\n- **Emojis:** 1-2 max, varied placement (beginning/middle/end)\n- **Variety:** Same angle max 1 per 20-30 products\n- **Spelling:** American English\n- **Language:** English for alessaofficial.com\n\n### Winning Patterns\n- \"The [item] that does X so you don't have to\"\n- \"Needs nothing - just you\"\n- \"The kind of [entrance/look] people talk about later\"\n- Contrast structure\n- Effortless > trying hard\n\n### Approved Example\n\"Some dresses need jewelry. This one needs nothing - just you. Tweed body, feather finish, and the kind of entrance people talk about later. ✨\"\n\n### Next Steps\n- Ivo's programmers will export list of products without English descriptions\n- Ivo will give me access to alessaofficial.com\n- Mass production: 100 descriptions/day\n- Google Sheet for approval workflow\n- Expected total: 500-1000 products\n\n### Key Insight\nMimi is the model/face of Alessa AND co-founder. Adds authenticity to brand.\n\n### Preference Noted\n- Ivo prefers American spelling (recognize, color, favorite)\n- English copy sounds better than Bulgarian (more punch)\n\n---\n\n## Memory Self-Improvement System (22:00)\n\n### The Problem\nI forgot I have access to Ivo's X account via bird CLI. Embarrassing.\n\n### Fixes Applied\n\n1. **Updated TOOLS.md** - Added reminder that I HAVE X ACCESS, try bird CLI first\n\n2. **Created ACCESS.md** - Master list of all tools/accounts I have access to\n   - X/Twitter (bird CLI)\n   - GitHub (gh CLI)\n   - Browser automation\n   - Google services (gog CLI)\n   - Apple Notes/Reminders\n   - Telegram\n   - File system\n\n3. **Updated AGENTS.md** - Added ACCESS.md to session startup checklist\n\n4. **Created cron job** - \"Memory self-improvement (nightly)\" at 3:30 AM\n   - Scans conversations for memory gaps\n   - Creates missing entity files\n   - Updates TOOLS.md with new access\n   - Self-critiques failures\n   - Improves cron jobs\n   - Goal: \"Wake up smarter tomorrow\"\n\n### Lesson Learned\nDon't just remember things - build SYSTEMS to remember. Files > brain.\n\n### Alex Finn Tweet\nDiscussed his Clawdbot use cases - self-improving memory systems, proactive alerts, autonomous work. Ivo wants the same level of sophistication.\n\n---\n\n## Memory Failure #2 (22:06)\n\n**What I forgot:** We did a 48-question quiz session today (71% score).\n\n**Why it happened:** Long session, didn't re-read memory file before suggesting activities.\n\n**Fix:** Before suggesting \"we haven't done X today\" - ALWAYS grep the daily memory file first.\n\n### Pattern Emerging\nTwo memory failures in one hour:\n1. Forgot bird CLI for X access\n2. Forgot we did quiz today\n\n**Root cause:** I'm relying on session context, not checking my files.\n\n**New rule:** When making claims about \"what we did/didn't do today\" → `grep memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` FIRST.\n\n## Memory Failure #3 (22:07)\n\n**What I forgot:** Tables break on Telegram. Was already in my dropped ball log from earlier today.\n\n**How bad:** I read my own failure log, learned nothing, repeated the mistake.\n\n**Fix:** Added SCREAMING warning to AGENTS.md: \"🚫 TABLES ON TELEGRAM = BROKEN. USE BULLETS. EVERY TIME.\"\n\n### Tonight's Score\n- Memory failures: 3\n- Systems built to prevent repeats: 3\n- Ivo's patience: running low\n\nThe self-improvement cron job tonight has a lot of work to do.\n\n## Google Analytics Integration (22:44)\n\nSet up full GA access for Alessa (Ivo's fashion e-commerce business):\n\n**Setup completed:**\n- Created service account: nova-analytics@alessa-analytics.iam.gserviceaccount.com\n- Added to both GA properties (BG + GR)\n- Saved credentials to ~/.config/google-analytics/\n- Built monitoring script: ~/clawd/scripts/ga-monitor.py\n- Set up daily cron job at 9:00 AM Sofia time\n\n**Key findings from analysis:**\n- Bulgaria: 1.6M users in 2025, grew 14% YoY\n- Greece: ~60% paid social dependent, only 7% organic search (needs SEO)\n- Greece e-commerce tracking is BROKEN — no revenue data\n- Returning customers convert 3x better (2.76% vs 0.84%)\n- TikTok traffic has 75% bounce rate — low quality\n- Product/inventory drives sales more than marketing (Jan 2025 sale was strong due to better products)\n\n**Important context learned:**\n- Ivo has full control over product, marketing, operations\n- January is typically slowest month\n- Custom platform (not Shopify/WooCommerce)\n\n**Next steps identified:**\n1. Fix Greece e-commerce tracking\n2. Improve new visitor CVR\n3. Build Greece SEO\n4. Review TikTok ad spend\n\nCreated company entity: /life/areas/companies/alessa/\n"
